This work was carried out in the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming curricular unit, aiming to build a single-player C++ game about territorial conquest and expansion. The player starts with a territory and must conquer new territories in order to build an empire. Throughout the game there are some elements necessary for it to be successful while conquering new territories. The game takes place over twelve turns or until the player loses his entire empire. The objective is to obtain the highest possible score by managing effectively the available resources.
